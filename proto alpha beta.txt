prototype:
    mirrors what final system will look like
    everything running where it will be in the end
        CAS working, everything hosted

    plumbing, list of features
    core functionality

alpha:
    anything planned to put in the final project should be there
    bugs ok, but mostly implmented
    someone who is not us should have a general idea of how to use the site
    if everything works, hit some stretch goals

beta:
    everything works, more polished
