Making psql work:
1.  Edit /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/pg_hba.conf:
    Change line 'local  all     all     peer'
             to 'local  all     all     trust'

    This turns off authentication for connections to the psql server from localhost.

2.  Run 'sudo -u postgres psql'.
    This will let you run psql by pretending to be the user named 'postgres'.

3.  In psql, run 'CREATE USER admin WITH PASSWORD password;'
    Don't forget the semicolon.

4.  Still in psql, run 'CREATE DATABASE ptonptx2;'

5.  Run 'sudo service postgresql restart'
