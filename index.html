<P> The existing PTX is a great idea--every college student will inevitably need textbooks, and, broke as we all are, will invariably want them for as cheap as possible. However, the current iteration is somewhat buggy, extremely slow and static, and has fallen essentially out of usage. We propose PTX2, an improved version of PTX that will support more dynamic searching, Blackboard reading list integration, and a new inventory management system, which will all work to make bargain textbook finding as easy as it should and needs to be.
